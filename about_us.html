         <h2>History</h2>
         <p>Lunarch Apparel was a meer hobby that turned into an intense passion.

         Lunarch Apparel is a small business that was created by Tania Parker in 2024. She first engaged with shoe making as she was intriged by the thought and decided to join shoe making classes. She then fell in love with the craft and decided to try out 
         making bags. She soon fell deeply passionate about that too and decided to make something out of her newfound skill, thus deciding to create Lunarch Apparel.
         Tania first started using Moksi as a platform to start selling her products on, however she wanted to expand the brand and chose to create a website for the business!
         Funny story, the name Lunarch Apparel is a mix of her two dogs names, Luna and Archer, her most loved fur babies.
         So that is how her love for handmaking these leather goods led her to the creation of her passion project. Tania hopes to further expand the business by making other genuine leather goods such as sunglasses pouches, wallets and belts.

<!--Adding in cutomer reviews was requested by the owner as other customers opinions can be proving to other potential cutomers, however, the business has not recieved any reviews yet.-->
<!--In part one I decided to leave this section blank, but for part 2 I decided to add in a form where customers can leave any reviews if they feel like it. A form in my opinion makes it easier for customers to leave and navigate any thoughts about the business.-->
